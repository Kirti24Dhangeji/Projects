Sudoku Master | C++ Console Application*

* Designed and developed an *interactive 9×9 Sudoku game* using C++, where the user manually plays the puzzle while the program validates every move in real time.
* Implemented *Sudoku rule checking logic* to ensure uniqueness of numbers across rows, columns, and 3×3 sub-grids before allowing a value to be placed.
* Used recursive backtracking concepts* to handle incorrect move paths, visually indicating failed attempts and guiding the user back to valid positions.
* Built an undo and redo system using stack data structures, enabling users to reverse or reapply moves without restarting the game.
* Maintained a separate cell-state tracking mechanism to differentiate between given values, correct user inputs, empty cells, and backtracked positions.
* Created a color-coded console interface using ANSI escape sequences to enhance usability and clearly represent game states.
* Applied *object-oriented programming principles* to structure the game logic, board display, and validation functions efficiently.
C++, OOP, Data Structures (Stack), Recursion & Backtracking, 2D Arrays.
